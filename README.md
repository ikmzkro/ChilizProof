# FanToban

## Project Description

**FanToban** is a Web3 application that recognizes stadium supporters as contributors,  
recording their presence on-chain and designing token-based rewards based on their roles, attendance history, and level of support.  

More than just spectators, FanToban empowers fans to turn their **cheering itself** into  
**proof of contribution** and **a source of reward**, redefining the stadium experience.

## How It Works

This project combines the following elements:

- Role definitions based on seat type and style of support  
- On-chain recording of attendance, roles, and presence per match  
- Pull-based reward distribution using the Splits Protocol
