## ðŸŒ¶ Introduction ðŸŒ¶

This project aims to address challenges faced by Chiliz, such as fan engagement, ownership, and limitations in interactivity, by distributing fan tokens issued on the Chiliz Chain based on fan contributions and issuing attendance proof NFTs. The token distribution contract based on fan contributions is highly suitable for this purpose due to its versatility, security, and portability. These attributes make it ideal for enhancing liquidity supply of existing fan tokens on the Chiliz Chain. Furthermore, by integrating with Move to Earn platforms like PUML and staking contracts, it can significantly expand opportunities for fan contributions to clubs, thereby greatly enlarging the fan community.

## ðŸŒ¶ UseCase ðŸŒ¶

1. Stadium Attendance

    - During stadium attendance, we issue fan tokens and attendance proof NFTs based on contributions, providing access rights to perks and exclusive entry gates. We establish a scheme where seats closer to the cheering leaders can earn more fan tokens through MOM voting at halftime, with winners receiving fan tokens distributed proportionally to their contributions, thereby enhancing fan engagement.

2. NFT Owner Exclusive Community

    - The NFT owner exclusive community issues NFTs as proof of participation to users attending stadium events, granting access to fan community privileges and exclusive entry gates.

3. NFT Games

    - In NFT games, fans can exchange fan tokens for club player NFTs to assemble squads and compete in games against other clubs issuing fan tokens on the Chiliz Chain.

### Component Relationships

- The Admin deploys the CreateFanTokenContract, SendFanTokenContract, and NftContract.
- When a User scans the QR code assigned to their seat and performs a MOM vote, their address, seat block, and voted player are registered in the system, triggering the CalculateContributionRateMethod.
- Using the address and distribution ratios calculated by CalculateContributionRateMethod, a Merkle tree is constructed using the CreateMerkleTreeMethod.
- A Merkle tree is also constructed using the CreateMerkleTreeMethod for an array composed of addresses and distribution quantities.
- The Merkle tree and Merkle proof obtained from CreateMerkleTreeMethod are provided to the Admin.
- After the match ends, the Admin registers the Merkle root with SendFanTokenContract and NftContract.
- The Admin distributes tokens using SendFanTokenContract.
- The Admin distributes NFTs using NftContract.

## ðŸŒ¶ Features ðŸŒ¶

### QR Code scanning functionality

The QR code scanning functionality verifies that spectators have indeed attended the stadium by designing a flow to scan QR codes attached to stadium seats and execute subsequent processes.

### CalculateContributionRateMethod

The CalculateContributionRateMethod is designed to increase the distribution rate of fan tokens based on two factors: proximity of the fan's seat to the cheering leader's seat and the success of MOM voting results. This allows for distributing rewards commensurate with supporters' levels of contribution.

### CreateMerkleTreeMethod

The CreateMerkleTreeMethod builds two types of Merkle trees and makes the resulting Merkle root and Merkle proof available to the operating entity's administrators:

1. It calculates the distribution amount of fan tokens for each address using the CalculateContributionRateMethod, converts them into an array, and constructs a Merkle tree.
2. It sets the issuance quantity of 1 NFT for each address, converts them into an array, and constructs a Merkle tree.

These processes enable administrators to manage and utilize the Merkle root and Merkle proof accordingly.

### CreateFanTokenContract

The CreateFanTokenContract can issue fan tokens for any club on the Chiliz Chain.

### SendFanTokenContract

The SendFanTokenContract can be executed following these steps:

1. Utilize the fan tokens issued by CreateFanTokenContract.
2. Register the Merkle root calculated by CreateMerkleTreeMethod with the contract.
3. Call the fan token transfer function with the Merkle proof as an argument, enabling the transfer of fan tokens to appropriate addresses based on their allocated amounts.

### NftContract

The NftContract can be executed following these steps:

1. Register the Merkle root calculated by CreateMerkleTreeMethod with the contract.
2. Call the NFT issuance function with the Merkle proof as an argument, enabling the distribution of NFTs to appropriate addresses based on their allocated quantities.

## ðŸŒ¶ Features Developed During the Hackathon ðŸŒ¶

In this hackathon, we developed a prototype of the Features and created a flow scenario demonstrating the interaction of CalculateContributionRateMethod, CreateMerkleTreeMethod, CreateFanTokenContract, SendFanTokenContract, and NftContract.

The flow involves:
- **User** executing CalculateContributionRateMethod and CreateMerkleTreeMethod.
- **Admin** executing CreateFanTokenContract, SendFanTokenContract, and NftContract.

Users log in to the site using MetaMask and can verify the distribution results of fan tokens and NFTs.

## ðŸŒ¶ Usage ðŸŒ¶

```
git clone git@github.com:ikmzkro/Chiliz-Sports-Hackathon.git && cd Chiliz-Sports-Hackathon
cd frontend && yarn && yarn dev
```
